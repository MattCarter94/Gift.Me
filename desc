The idea of this web application is to make buying gifts (birthdays, christmas etc) easier for everybody. The way this works is at follows:

Everybody in the family has an account of their own.
On your account, you can create a Christmas wishlist, where you can add a list of all the items you want for christmas (just like Amazon wishlists!).
The rest of your family are able to see your wishlist. They are able to pick items on your wishlist which will say, for example: "this item has been claimed by Matt" 
This means that Matt has decided he is going to buy that item, so other family members know not to buy the same thing!
